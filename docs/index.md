# ReviveMC74 Project:
As the community has grown, I've noticed that there really isn't a centralized location for all the information we've gathered together.

What I want to accomplish with this documentation is a full start-to-finish guide for all-things ReviveMC74. Including potential issues, solutions, and etc.

Hey there! [qwery26](https://github.com/qwery26)'s latest contributions have really stepped up the game! He recently added the ability to change ringtones, set custom wallpapers, etc. to the dialer, check out [customization](customization.md) for more information!
